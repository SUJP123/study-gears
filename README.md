# study-gears

Utilizing the openAI and Youtube API, I created a study bot that helps students maximize their study time by providing explanations and videos to help students with 
topics they are struggling on. Additionally, I created a task managing feature for the site in order to allow students to keep track of deadlines, assingments, and 
build an effective schedule.

# Technologies

This site used a springboot backend with a react.js fronted. A PostgreSQL database was used in order to manage and keep track of tasks and users of the site.
